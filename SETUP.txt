Setting up Nav Station on Linux

Software to install:
• OpenCPN
• OpenCPN RADAR Plugin for Koden RADARpc (homemade)
• zyGrib
• qtVLM
• pyRADAR Python Script
• Airmail under WINE
• gpsbabel (sudo apt-get install gpsbabel)
• redshift (sudo apt-get install redshift)
• Nautical Almanac 1.5-1 (sudo apt-get install nautic)

Also check out software included in Navigation Distros:
• Xinutop-nav OS 4.0
• Navigatrix

SETTING UP pyRADAR script on Linux:
• Go to Network Connection "Edit Connection..."
• Add a new Ethernet Connection named "Koden MDS-5R"
• Go to the "IPv4 Settings" tab and change method to "Manual"
• Add a new address under Addresses with the following info:
∘ Address: 192.168.0.100
∘ Netmask: 255.255.255.0
∘ Gateway: (blank or 0.0.0.0)
• Check the box at the bottom that says: "Require IPv4 addressing for this connection to complete"
• Save the connection
• Plug in the RADAR ethernet cable and turn the radar on
• Select connection in the Network Connection and the computer should connect to the RADAR with IP details as above (check by running ifconfig)

COMPILING OpenCPN on Ubuntu:
• As per the instructions here: 
∘ http://opencpn.org/ocpn/compiling_source_linux
• If the compiler throws a lot of errors about "cannot pass objects of non-trivially-copyable" when it comes to compile the radar plugin then simply add ".c_str()" (without quotes) to the offending variables in the fPrintf calls
• Compiled without a problem on 11/08/2014

Setting up GPS:
• Follow the instructions from "We start with gpsd" from here:
∘ http://opencpn.org/ocpn/setting_up_gps
• Worked perfectly on Ubuntu 14.04 on 11/08/2014
• Check GPSD is working before starting OpenCPN by:
∘ sudo /etc/init.d/gpsd status
∘ sudo /etc/init.d/gpsd restart

# If you are having trouble connecting (as with Cubietruck) then first check that root is able to access GPS streaming data with gpsmon
sudo gpsmon /dev/ttyUSB1
# If this works then at least you have a connection to the GPS
# To get it working try the trick at the bottom of this page:
# http://blog.retep.org/2012/06/18/getting-gps-to-work-on-a-raspberry-pi/
sudo killall gpsd
sudo rm -v /var/run/gpsd.sock
sudo gpsmon /dev/ttyUSB1
sudo gpsd /dev/ttyUSB1 -F /var/run/gpsd.sock
sudo service ntp restart

Set up udev to assign serial-to-usb devices to a particular /dev/tty address:
# You can find what device is assigned to a particular tty as follows:
udevadm info -q all -n /dev/ttyUSB0
udevadm info -a -p  /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1c.3/0000:19:00.0/usb3/3-1/3-1.1/3-1.1.2/3-1.1.2:1.0/ttyUSB4/tty/ttyUSB4
# Follow the guide in the SETUP_GPS folder for setting up persistent symlinks

Installing Airmail under WINE:
• Ensure that you have spellchecker turned off after install otherwise you can get some strange behaviour as outlined here:
