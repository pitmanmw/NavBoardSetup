# To get glmark and glmark-es2
sudo apt-get install glmark glmark-es2

# To get es2gears
sudo apt-get install mesa-utils-extra

# Installing qt5-qmake also installed lib-mesa2 (or something like that) which broke hardware accelleration.  Fixed by 
apt-get remove qt5-qmake && apt-get autoremove

# OpenCPN compile failed saying that it could not find lEGL.  Fixed with:
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/mali-egl/libEGL.so /usr/lib/libEGL.so
# Not sure if this should have been (but OpenCPN continued to compile without a problem an seemed to run fine at the end):
# sudo ln -s /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/mesa-egl/libEGL.so /usr/lib/libEGL.so
