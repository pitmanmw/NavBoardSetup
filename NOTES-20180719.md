# Installing CANBOAT

 * Follow instructions at wiki here: 
   * github.com/canboat/canboat/wiki/Building
   * github.com/canboat/canboat/wiki/nk2d_monitor
 * sudo apt-get install libconfig-general-perl
 * sudo vim /etc/default/n2kd

 * NOTE! MicroUSB input to back of the Cubie is only for charging.  Therefore the intputs to the USB Hub are not being discovered.  Change the cable from the USB hub to a normal USB and input to Cubie.

## Find relevant /dev/tty devices and set to auto load by doing
 * After plugging in the USB do "dmesg" 
 * dmesg showed that /dev/ttyUSB0 was plugged in, then do
 * udevadm info -q all -n /dev/ttyUSB0
 * udevadm info -a -p /devices/platform/sw-ohci.1/usb3/3-1/3-1:1.0/ttyUSB0/tty/ttyUSB0
 * This showed that the idVendor is "0403" and the idProduct is "d9aa"
 * Added this entry to udev/rules.d/99-usb**
 * Now the actisense is discovered and mapped to /dev/actisense/ on each restart. Test that it works by doing (as a normal user):
actisense-serial -r /dev/actisense

)

## Check that CANBOAT is getting the right information
 * Run this command:
actisense-serial -r /dev/actisense | analyzer -json
 * You should see lots of information scrolling up like this:
{"timestamp":"2018-07-19T09:15:48.072Z","prio":2,"src":130,"dst":255,"pgn":129025,"description":"Position, Rapid Update","fields":{"Latitude":55.7260886,"Longitude":12.5877886}}

 * From this you can see which NMEA fields CANBOAT is able to read from the NMEA2000 bus (in this case it is:
   * Position (latitude/longitude)
   * Wind Speed, Wind Angle, Reference (apparent/true)
   * COG, SOG, Reference (True)
   * Temperature, Temperature Source (sea temperature)
   * Log, Trip log
   * Speed water Referenced, Speed Water Referenced Type (Paddle Wheel)
   * Rudder angle
   * Depth
   * AIS Class A/B Position Reports
   * Raymarine Proprietary fast-packet addressed (non-readable)


## Running n2kd_monitor as a daemon service
 * Apply fix as outlined here to prevent n2kd_monitor from forking every 30 seconds:
